- Questions from audience :
  Hi Vikram, few points i had in my mind but could not share the other day:

    - Hypersign Identity Network - it has a scale problem in pvt sector. It wont get scale unless there are users and it wont get users unless there is scale. That's why most blockchains are run by trade associations or govt users.

    - education certificate use case is already on govt radar at all India level thru digi locker. Does it really require blockchain to resolve. It could be a huge database-2-database connection b/w say India and US once there are country level databases

    - airline ticket validation - airports are already integrating systems using APIs and it may not be long before security systems wud be integrated to airline and doing auto validation (already being done at Blr airport as i heard due to corona).

    My views, product seems right but some pertinent questions from a business point of view.
