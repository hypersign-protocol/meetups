# Hypersign Meetups

With the growth of World Wide Web, the digital identity space is growing at a massive pace. Due to this, there has been significant growth in many cases of user data hack, frauds and identity theft.

Hypersign is consistently working on SSI space for quite some time and coming up with a global decentralised identity network built on Cosmos SDK. We invite you to join the meetup and build a trustless and open community to discuss SSI, its use cases and how Hypersign is implementing this network.
